A tree planting android app for all those who love planting trees(Arborists) and for the greater good of mother nature,it's inspired by the [Rotaract Club Of Taita Taveta University](https://twitter.com/RotaractClubTTU),[Rotaract Club Of Voi](https://twitter.com/RotaractVoi) and [Rotary Club of Voi ](https://twitter.com/RotaryVoi) who devoted they time once a while to plant trees as a way of giving back to our ecosystem. The app takes into account trees planted by different individuals, their species, region and exact geopoint.
