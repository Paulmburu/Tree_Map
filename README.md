- [Rotaract Club Of Taita Taveta University](https://twitter.com/RotaractClubTTU),
- [Rotaract Club Of Voi](https://twitter.com/RotaractVoi) and 
- [Rotary Club of Voi ](https://twitter.com/RotaryVoi) <br>
They devoted their time once a while to plant trees as a way of giving back to our ecosystem. The app takes into account trees planted by different individuals, their species, region and exact geopoint. A feature in progress is to send reminder's to Arborist to water their trees based on the Tree type.

  persistence.
  * [Data Binding][2] - Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements.
  * [Lifecycles][3] - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events.
  * [LiveData][4] - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
  * [Navigation][5] - Handle everything needed for in-app navigation.
  * [Room][6] - Access app's SQLite database with in-app objects and compile-time checks.
  * [ViewModel][7] - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations.
* Third party
  * [Kotlin Coroutines][12] for managing background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks
